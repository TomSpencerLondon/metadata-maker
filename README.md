# MetadataMaker

## Editing institution information

The records produced by MetadataMaker list the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as the institution that created the records, and as the location of the physical holding. To change the institution, edit the strings created in **generateInstitutionInfo()** in **marcmaker.js**.

## Browser compatibility

The recommended browsers for MetadataMaker are Chrome and Firefox. MetadataMaker is not yet fully functional in Internet Explorer or Safari. While Opera was not specifically targeted in the development of this tool, light testing suggests it is compatible.

## Updates
